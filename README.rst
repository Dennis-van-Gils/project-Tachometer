Tachometer
==========

A stand-alone Arduino tachometer using a transmissive photointerrupter with an
optical encoder disk.

The rotation rate is displayed on an OLED screen. The units can be switched
between RPM, rev/s and rad/s by pressing one of the OLED screen buttons. The
display will go blank when no rotation has been detected after a certain
timeout period.

Change the global constant `N_SLITS_ON_DISK` to match the number of slits on
your encoder disk.
